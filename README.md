# üõçÔ∏è Shopping Cart Promotions Engine

This Java project implements a flexible and extensible **Shopping Cart System** that supports **multiple promotions**, **custom product sorting strategies**, and follows key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles including **SOLID design**, **Command Pattern**, and **Strategy Pattern**.

## üìå Features

- üõí **Shopping Cart** with support for multiple products
- üéØ **Promotion Engine** with various promotional strategies:
  - Percentage discount above a threshold
  - Free product giveaways
  - Buy-2-get-1-free logic
  - Single product discount coupon
- üßÆ **Promotion Optimizer** that evaluates all permutations of promotions to apply the best combination
- ‚úÖ **Test Suite** written using JUnit (AAA pattern)
- üîÄ **Sorting Strategies**:
  - Price descending
  - Name alphabetical
  - Combined (price + name)

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Products** are added to the `ShoppingCart`.
2. The cart contents are **sorted** using a chosen strategy (e.g., price descending).
3. A set of **Promotions** is defined.
4. The `PromotionOptimizer` evaluates all permutations of these promotions to find the **optimal final price**.
5. The best combination of promotions is applied, and the final total is displayed.

---

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a full suite of **unit tests** in:

- `PromotionTest.java`
- `ShoppingCartTest.java`

Tests follow the **AAA (Arrange‚ÄìAct‚ÄìAssert)** structure.

To run tests using Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

(or use your IDE‚Äôs built-in test runner)

## üß† Design Patterns & SOLID Principles & Algorithmic Optimization

### ‚úÖ Design Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern
- Used to implement **flexible product sorting strategies**.
- Allows dynamic selection of sorting logic at runtime without altering core business logic.

#### Command Pattern
- Applied to **encapsulate promotions as command objects**.
- Decouples promotion logic from the shopping cart, enabling dynamic queuing, applying, or removal of promotions.

#### (Inspired) Event Sourcing Pattern
- Promotions are recorded as a sequence of **command events**, allowing deferred execution and reconstruction of the cart state.
- Although simplified, this approach decouples events from the final state computation.

---

### ‚ö° Algorithmic Optimization

#### Depth-First Search (DFS) with Branch Pruning
- Originally, the optimizer generated all permutations of promotions, which resulted in performance issues (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError` for 100 promotions).
- After optimization, the project uses a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach combined with **branch pruning** (Branch & Bound technique).
- This drastically reduces the search space by cutting off non-promising paths early, achieving **optimal promotion application** in a **fraction of the time**.
- Thanks to pruning, 100 promotions can now be processed efficiently without causing memory overflow or significant delays.

---

### üß± SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has **one clear responsibility** (e.g., `ShoppingCart`, `PromotionOptimizer`, `Promotion` implementations).

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- The system is **open for extension** (new promotions, new sorters) **without modifying existing code**.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All classes implementing the `Promotion` interface can be **substituted** without altering system correctness.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Interfaces like `Promotion` and `Command` are **small, focused, and precise**.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on **abstractions, not implementations**.
- Promotes **clean architecture and unit testing**.

> üí° Thanks to algorithmic improvements and a solid architecture, this project achieves **both optimal performance and clean design**, fully aligned with modern software engineering practices.
